## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using API keys. Include your API key in the Authorization header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://app.nex.ai/api/developers
```

## Scopes

Each API key has specific scopes that control what operations it can perform. Request the scopes you need when generating your API key.

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `object.read` | Read object definitions and their attributes |
| `object.write` | Create, update, and delete object definitions, attributes, and lists |
| `record.read` | Read records, search, and view timelines |
| `record.write` | Create, update, and delete records and list memberships |
| `list.read` | Read list definitions |
| `list.member.read` | Read list members and records |
| `list.member.write` | Add, update, and remove list members |
| `relationship.read` | Read relationship definitions |
| `relationship.write` | Create and delete relationship definitions and instances |
| `task.read` | Read tasks |
| `task.write` | Create, update, and delete tasks |
| `note.read` | Read notes |
| `note.write` | Create, update, and delete notes |
| `insight.stream` | SSE insight streaming |

## Data Model Overview

Nex uses an Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) model that provides flexible data storage for different types of CRM records. This architecture allows you to:

- Define custom object types (entity definitions) with their own attributes
- Create records (entities) that conform to these definitions
- Store attribute values that can be of various types (text, email, relationships, etc.)
- Define relationships between object types
- Track activity with tasks, notes, and timeline events

## Core Resources

### Objects (Entity Definitions)

Objects define the structure and schema for your CRM data types. Think of them as "templates" or "blueprints" for creating records.

**Default Objects:**

- **Person**: Individual contacts with attributes like name, email, job title, company relationships
- **Company**: Organization records with attributes like name, domain, industry, team relationships

You can also create custom object types (e.g., "Project", "Deal") and define their attributes via the Schema endpoints.

### Records (Entities)

Records are instances of your object definitions - the actual data entries in your CRM.

**Example Person Record Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "789",
  "object_id": "123",
  "type": "person",
  "workspace_id": "456",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2024-01-20T14:30:00Z",
  "attributes": {
    "name": "John Smith",
    "email_addresses": ["john@example.com", "j.smith@company.com"],
    "job_title": "Software Engineer"
  }
}
```

> **Note**: For many attribute types like `full_name`, `phone`, and `location`, you can use either simple string values (e.g., `"John Smith"`) or structured objects (e.g., `{"first_name": "John", "last_name": "Smith"}`). The API accepts both formats.

### Relationships

Relationships define how object types relate to each other (e.g., Person → Company). You can create relationship definitions between any two object types, then create instances linking specific records.

**Relationship types:** `one_to_one`, `one_to_many`, `many_to_many`

### Lists

Lists allow you to organize and group records for campaigns, segments, or any custom categorization. Lists are associated with specific object types.

### Tasks

Tasks are actionable items that can be associated with records and assigned to users. Tasks support priorities (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `urgent`), due dates, and completion tracking. Deleting a task archives it (soft delete).

### Notes

Notes are free-form text entries that can be associated with records. Deleting a note archives it (soft delete).

### Timeline

The timeline provides a chronological activity feed for any record, including tasks, notes, attribute changes, and relationship events. Supports cursor-based pagination.

### Search

Full-text search across all records in the workspace. Results are grouped by object type and include relevance scores.

## Attribute Types

When creating attributes via the Schema endpoints, the following types are supported:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `text` | Free-form text |
| `number` | Numeric values (integer or decimal) |
| `email` | Email addresses |
| `phone` | Phone numbers |
| `url` | URLs |
| `date` | Dates |
| `boolean` | True/false values |
| `currency` | Currency amounts |
| `location` | Physical addresses |
| `select` | Predefined options (single or multi-select) |
| `social_profile` | Social media profiles |
| `domain` | Web domains |
| `full_name` | Structured names (first/last) |

## Pagination

The API uses two pagination styles:

- **Offset-based**: Used by records, tasks, and list records. Responses include `total`, `limit`, `offset`, and `has_more`/`next_offset` fields.
- **Cursor-based**: Used by timeline. Responses include `has_next_page` and `next_cursor` fields.

## Error Handling

All error responses follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "code": 400,
  "message": "Description of what went wrong"
}
```

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `400` | Bad request - Invalid input data |
| `401` | Unauthorized - Invalid or missing API key |
| `404` | Not found - Resource doesn't exist |
| `429` | Too many requests - Rate limit exceeded |
| `500` | Internal server error |

## Common Use Cases

- **Contact Management**: Create and update person and company records
- **Schema Customization**: Define custom object types and attributes
- **Relationship Mapping**: Link people to companies and track team structures
- **List Management**: Organize contacts into targeted lists for campaigns
- **Task Tracking**: Create follow-up tasks associated with contacts
- **Note Taking**: Attach meeting notes and context to records
- **Activity Feed**: View the complete timeline of changes for any record
- **Search**: Find records across your entire workspace
- **Data Enrichment**: Update records with additional information from external sources
- **AI Context**: Add unstructured context and query your CRM with natural language
